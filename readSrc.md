## pWorkout App Documentation

This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of the pWorkout app, a web application designed for fitness tracking and workout logging.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- **App.js**: The main component of the application, responsible for routing and rendering different views based on the user's navigation.
- **App.test.js**: A test file for the App component, ensuring its correct functionality.
- **index.js**: The entry point for the application, rendering the App component within the React.StrictMode environment.
- **reportWebVitals.js**: A file for measuring and reporting web vitals, used for performance analysis and optimization.
- **setupTests.js**: A configuration file for jest-dom, a library providing custom matchers for DOM assertions.
- **components**: A directory containing various components used throughout the application.

### Components

The following components are included in the project:

- **Login**: Provides a form for users to log in to their accounts.
- **Signup**: Allows new users to create accounts.
- **Dashboard**: Displays the user's workout history, progress, and other relevant data.
- **LogExercise**: Enables users to log their completed exercises, including details like name, sets, reps, and weight.
- **Home**: The landing page of the application, potentially showcasing features and providing a link to login/signup.

### Routing

The App component utilizes React Router Dom for navigation between different pages within the application. The following routes are defined:

- **"/":**  The home page.
- **"/signup":**  The signup page.
- **"/login":** The login page.
- **"/dashboard":** The dashboard page.
- **"/log-exercise":** The exercise logging page.
